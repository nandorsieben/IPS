## Python code to compute invariant polydiagonal subspaces

CPMpy: Uses the CP-SAT solver of Google's ortools package as the default solver. Can use other solvers. Simple syntax makes it easy to modify the code.

DOcplex: Uses IBM's CP Oprimizer. Requires separate installation of the CP Optimizer. Expect fast solving of simpler problems.

ORtools: Uses the CP-SAT solver of Google's ortools package. Best for larger problems. Syntax more involved.

Z3: Uses Microsoft's Z3 Theorem Prover.
